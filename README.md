## Why this Project

Building a layout and populating its fields from data received as JSON
is a common task for Android Developers. Although JSON parsing is usually
done using libraries, writing the JSON parsing for  this project manually will
help me to better understand how it is processed.

## Goal?
Through this project, I will:
- Practice designing skills
- Practice JSON parsing to a model object
- Design an activity layout
- Populate all fields in the layout accordingly
